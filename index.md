## Welcome to the Epic Gaming Adventure

Join us on an extraordinary journey through the Bean Raid chronicles, where epic battles, legendary loot, and unforgettable moments await.

### [Week 1 — 8/17 — Pilot: Beans Before Keys](pages/week1/week1.html)
We debut in Omega Manaforge with the Bean Ethos: if it isn't beans, it's garnish. The raid chooses beans and keys over the sanctity of main raid.

### [Week 2 — 8/24 — Beans vs. Beams](pages/week2/week2.html)
Back in Omega Manaforge with new faces and full confidence. Normal falls like dominos, then Heroic Plexus Sentinel introduces us to geometry.

### [Week 3 — 8/31 — Beans on the Brink](pages/week3/week3.html)
Confidence restored after geometry lessons, we march back into Heroic Plexus Sentinel. Beans > beams, confirmed.
